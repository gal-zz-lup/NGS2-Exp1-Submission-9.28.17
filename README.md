# R scripts to analyse NGS2 WITNESS Cycle 1 experiment 1 - Sep 28 submission

This repository holds all the R code and data related to experiment 1 of the NGS2 cycle 1.
CSV Breadboard csv outputs are the inputs for r scripts in this repository. 
The data in this repository represents a partial submission for the September 28 deadline, with a very limited sample. As such, the results of our analyses are underpowered, and in some cases, not available at all. 
We expect to conduct further data collection and submit a final set of results.
